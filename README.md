# [Project Sunday]

This project was created to predict future stock prices using an LSTM model backed by Keras.

## What's done

- Created a RESTful API with Flask to provide historical stock prices of VCN.TO.
- Created a skeleton for the frontend that defines the basic flow of the UI.

## What's next

- Create the LSTM model to predict future stock prices of VCN.TO.
- Support other stock listings.
- Display information in a UI.
